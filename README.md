# Video-Element-Extractor
Getting video element/video src on a page. Particularly useful<sup>*</sup> if the page embeds external videos and we need the videos' source to feed into a video player, such as VLC or a Chromecast app (one example is here: https://heroku-cast.herokuapp.com/)

In Chrome: go to http://chrome://extensions/ (remove the 'http://')

Enable Developer mode

Load Unpacked Extension

Load the cloned directory

Open a video website, wait for it to finish loading and click on the extension icon (a V shape one). If notthing's there, no video element is found --> PR welcomed :)
